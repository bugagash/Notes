# Probability theory
The CLT states that:
	Â under appropriate conditions, the distribution of a normalized version of the sample mean converges to a standard normal distribution.

# Statistics
The CLT can be stated as:
	Let $X_1, ..., X_n$ denote a statistical sample of size n with expected value $\mu$ and finite positive variance $\sigma^2 < \infty$ and let random value $\overline{X_n}$  denote the sample mean. Then:
	$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sqrt{\mu} (\overline{X_n} - \mu) \rightarrow N(0, 1)$$
$N(0, 1)$ is a [[Distributions#Normal distribution]] with mean 0 and variance 1.
